Java API for HTML to ASCIIDOC Conversion.

This project is a fork of https://github.com/asciidocfx/HtmlToAsciidoc[HtmlToAsciidoc] project
and it is using its javascript library for HTML to ASCIIDOC conversion.
The javascript library is wrapped in java API and run inside of JVM javascript engine.

The final goal of this project is to provide fully flagged java implementation of HTML to ASCIIDOC converter

for HTML to ASCIIDOC conversions, and possibly other markup conversions.
